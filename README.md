A simple application that locates the restaurants near the user using Google Places APIs.
The restaurants are displayed as pin in a map or as items of a list - they can be located within 1 mile radius. The user will be able to refresh the list of the restaurants in both the views.

Once the application is running in the simulator, choose a location from 
Debug -> Simulate Location in the XCode menu.
Clicking on "Restaurants", the full list of restaurants near the current location
will be updated in the view (map or list).

The application uses Cocoapods. To install them, run from terminal the following
commands:
- sudo gem install cocoapods
- pod setup
